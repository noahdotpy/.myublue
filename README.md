# noahdotpy/myfedora

> **Warning** This repository is solely intended for only my purpose and may bring breaking changes without warning.

This is a constantly updating repository which hosts my personalised Fedora Atomic images - [built with container technology](https://containers.github.io/bootable/).
GitHub will build this image, and then host it on [ghcr.io](https://github.com/features/packages).
The users can then tell the computer to boot off of that image.
GitHub keeps 90 days worth of image backups for us, thanks Microsoft!

## Images

The images this repository offers are `kova` (Kinoite), `silvara` (Silverblue),
`kova-hypr` (Kinoite + Hyprland), and `silvara-hypr` (Silverblue + Hyprland).

### Tags

Tags are based on the Fedora version it is based on. An example tag is `41`,
which is based on Fedora 41.

If you only use the Fedora version as your tag then you will get weekly builds
started at 4:30AM every Sunday (UTC), but you can add `-git` to your image ref
tag to get additional builds when a git commit is pushed to the default branch
of this repo. An example tag is `41-git`, which is based on Fedora 41.

## Installation

The image reference format for any image in this repo is `ghcr.io/noahdotpy/{image}:{tag}`.

For example, if you want Silvara on Fedora 41 and image builds weekly and on git
pushes then you would want the following tag:
`ghcr.io/noahdotpy/silvara:41-git`.

### ISO (recommended)

This repository includes a justfile recipe to build ISOs locally from the GHCR registry.

Below is an example of building an ISO for silvara:41-git

```bash
just build-iso-ghcr silvara:41-git
```

### Switching from a Fedora Atomic image

Below is an example of switching to silvara:41-git

1. `bootc switch ghcr.io/noahdotpy/silvara:41-git`

2. Reboot computer

# TODO: allow any user in `idwt-tightener` group to add to config without password
#         - This would probably be in the form of `config ...` commands, 
#           although I might need to make a small wrapper like the old block-flatpak.sh
#           which wrote the `flatpak to block` to a file named ~/.cache/block-this-flatpak.
#           The apply command would then use this. The sudoers.d/allow-idwt file would then
#           allow this wrapper script to be used by anyone in the `idwt-tightener` group/
# TODO: investigate schema validation for config.yml
